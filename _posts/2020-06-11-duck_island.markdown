[Saturn91][saturn91] and I joined the [I Can't Draw But Want To Make A Game (Again) Jam][jam] in June 2020. The jam's theme was "The Beach".

It was our second Game Jam and we had a lot of fun. Our game was included in the honourable mentions.
Our submission: "Duck Island". [Play it here][duck]

You play as a duck, but you want to be a phoenix :D
