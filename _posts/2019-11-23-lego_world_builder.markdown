I used to play the old Lego flash games a lot when I was a kid. I  completed Lego World Builder several times (of course both parts). However, I always got upset about the controls and the way too small game window. Now that I'm older, I can program the game myself as I like. Some time ago I started reprogramming the game in Unity. I tried to stay as close to the original as possible. But I paused the project. If I continue to work on it, I will present the progress in a new post.
