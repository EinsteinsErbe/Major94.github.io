[Saturn91][saturn91] and I joined the [GMTK Game Jam 2022][jam] in July 2022. The jam's theme was "Roll the Dice".

It was our 4th Game Jam. We dared to create a 3D game for the first time. For the first time, we no longer used the Unity Engine. Saturn91 was able to convince me of [PICO-8][pico8], a very compact fantasy console. This pixel engine has various strong limitations such as strict memory restrictions. In my opinion, this promotes creativity and brings forth a whole new kind of games with a special nostalgic charm.

After the brainstorming we agreed on a competitive dice game. After we had to discard many ideas, it became a small dice game in which you play against 5 opponents in a row. The aim of the game is to reduce the opponent's energy bar to 0 by rolling high numbers and combinations.

Our game reached the 960th place out of 6133 in the rating.

Our submission: "A dicy boss fight". [Play it here][game]
