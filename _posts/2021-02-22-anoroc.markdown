[Saturn91][saturn91] and I joined the [Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1][jam] in February 2021. The jam's theme was "Stronger together".

It was our third Game Jam. This time we were accompanied by [Alice_sqr][alice_sqr]. We dared to create a 3D game for the first time. After the brainstorming we agreed on a tower defense game. We also wanted to incorporate the pun "stronger to get her" somehow. 

In the end it turned out to be a very unusual and somewhat disturbing 3D tower defense game, in which you protect your spleen from viruses. You have to distribute white blood cells in your body and adjust them to match the receptors of the viruses.

Our game reached the 641st place out of 1885 in the rating.
In the "Innovation" category, we scored above average with 367th place.

Our submission: "ANOROC - Yo mama got the flu". [Play it here][anoroc]
